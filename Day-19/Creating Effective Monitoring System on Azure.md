### Key Concepts of Monitoring
1. **Definition of Monitoring**:
   - Monitoring goes beyond tracking CPU and memory usage; it involves overseeing various interconnected components of an application infrastructure.
   - Effective monitoring must cover all aspects of the application environment.

2. **Example Scenario**:
   - Example.com uses Azure for all resources, including Blob Storage and a Kubernetes cluster (AKS).
   - Users access applications that traverse multiple network and infrastructure layers.

### Components to Monitor
1. **Network Traffic**:
   - **Importance**: Essential for user access and experience; disruptions can lead to poor service quality.
   
2. **Kubernetes Nodes**:
   - Monitor node pools (virtual machine scale sets) for CPU and memory usage to ensure resources are adequate.

3. **Control Plane Components**:
   - Though managed by AKS, monitoring is critical for components like the API server and etcd to prevent user dissatisfaction.

4. **Workload Components**:
   - Monitor the performance of pods and containers to ensure operational integrity.

5. **Application Performance**:
   - Vital to monitor application response and capacity to handle user load effectively.

6. **Other Services**:
   - Includes storage accounts, virtual machines, and serverless functions.

### Levels of Monitoring
- **Six Levels of Monitoring**: 
  1. **Network Components**
  2. **Kubernetes Node Pools**
  3. **Control Plane Components**
  4. **Workload Components**
  5. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**
  6. **Other Azure Services**

### Recommended Tools for Each Level
1. **Network Monitoring**: 
   - **Azure Network Watcher**: For IP flow monitoring, network diagnostics, and troubleshooting.

2. **Node Monitoring**:
   - **Prometheus**: Preferred for monitoring CPU and memory usage; Azure offers a managed Prometheus service.

3. **Control Plane Monitoring**:
   - **Azure Monitor**: Recommended for monitoring AKS control plane components, integrates with container insights.

4. **Workload Monitoring**:
   - **Prometheus**: Again preferred for tracking pod/container parameters.

5. **Application Performance Monitoring**:
   - **Application Insights**: Part of Azure Monitor, useful for logging, tracing, and alerting based on application performance.

6. **Monitoring Other Azure Services**:
   - **Azure Monitor**: Can be used to integrate and monitor storage accounts, virtual machines, etc.

### Azure Monitor Overview
- **Functionality**: 
   - Collects metrics, logs, and traces from various Azure components.
   - Performs analysis to provide insights and recommendations, such as scaling resources or optimizing configurations.
   - Can integrate with visualization tools like Grafana and Power BI for better monitoring dashboards.
